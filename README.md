# Coursework for COSC242 Algorithms and Data Structures

COSC242 builds upon and extends on the variety of data types from COSC241 and looks more closely at the algorithms that operate on them. Among the new data types to be treated are balanced search trees and graphs. The performance of algorithms is a unifying theme throughout. This course also serves as an introduction to programming in C. I have uploaded all the coursework I could find though there are a few that are missing.
